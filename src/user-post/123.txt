1. My MongoDB database have a collection, in this collection, I stored some fields as below, remember that, my post in somewhere else, may be in AWS S3, just maybe, not in MongoDB, so I just have this post filename and path and user email.

_id: ObjectId('63f9d9141d94da5ca3b87af5')
filename: "fe0252b8-36c0-4821-8f77-cf9cda14cd77.jpg"
path:"files\fe0252b8-36c0-4821-8f77-cf9cda14cd77.jpg"
userEmail: "cai19980122@gmail.com"

2. I use Nestjs to build a post module, in this post module, I have post schema, post service, post controller and post module.

my post schema like this as below, this schema cannot change, just use this schema as below,

  _id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId;
    
    @Prop()
    filename: string;  
    
    @Prop()
    path: string;   
    
    
    @Prop()
    userEmail: string;

3. Now, I need  to build an api to provide a get request for frontend. To be specific, this api provides  all posts from this user email address. the url like "http://localhost:9090/api/post/useremail". you only use join or some methods like __dirname or whatever methods to code, do not try assume we have another service. 

4. In Controller, I need to return this post
